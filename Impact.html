<h1>Impact</h1>

<p>I'm just one person, with one life to give. So the impact I have on the world depends on one thing: leverage. </p>

<p>I make choices in my career based on that idea. The reason I'm in software, studying design, and looking for great teams, is that I believe those three choices are all high leverage. </p>

<p>Software has reshaped the world, and some might think its potential has been mostly tapped. But I worked in diabetesâ€“ an industry where millions of people suffer from a disease that software could've helped them prevent. </p>

<p>In the Bay Area, we recognize design as important. But the Fortune 500 is filled with companies who pay lip service to deep customer understanding and human-centered design, if they even recognize their value at all. Design is still under-used, and companies who know that are positioned to make a huge impact. </p>

<p>Finally, anyone who is serious about having an impact knows they can't do it alone. That's why I want to join Kleiner Perkins, and that's why I'm choosing a career in Product. I can't think of anything with more leverage than working on high-talent, cross-disciplinary teams. </p>

<p>My experience at Medtronic, Stanford, and Eventbrite has exposed me to the power of these three choices, given me the education I need to make a difference with them at one of your company partners. </p>

<p>High leverage: technology (in my own experience, I've seen , design (talking to people), and teams (cross-disciplinary work, work with other people) </p>
